#Employee Management System
Project Overview
The Employee Management System (EMS) is a Java-based application designed to manage employee data efficiently. This system allows for the addition, updating, deletion, and viewing of employee records. Additionally, it includes advanced features such as searching employees by name or department, sorting employees by salary, promoting employees, generating department reports, and managing employee attendance.
